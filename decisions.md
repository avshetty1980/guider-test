## Your decisions logs

## packages installed:

- minimal external libraries used
- Axios

## assumptions and limitations

- dates are hard-coded
- manipulate the DOM directly to highlight the active days, could be better with a library
- buttons that are "tentative" for generateOffice365Schedule() are shown as active

## how to get step 1/2 to work

- for step 1 please change the component in "App.js" to <Calendar/> and in Server/index.js use res.send(data)
- for step 2 please change the component in "App.js" to <Calendar2/> and in Server/index.js use res.send(response)
