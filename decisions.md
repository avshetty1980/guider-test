## Your decisions logs

## packages installed:

- minimal external libraries used
- Axios

## assumptions and limitations

- dates are hard-coded
- manipulate the DOM directly to highlight the active days, could be better with a library
- the date starts at 11th and goes to 17th, but once the date goes beyond that the calendar is no longer in sync with real world calendar.
